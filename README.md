# Need-Energy-Omdena
Predictive analytics for designing solar solutions or clean energy solutions for clients based on their projected energy usage/profile. This will help to increase energy adoption where it is most needed. This project includes database engineering, predictive modeling, and anomaly detection.

## The Problem
Sub-Saharan Africa has over 600 million people without access to electricity and electricity demand grows at an annual growth rate of 11%, the highest rate of any region worldwide. The number grows to over 700 million if clean cooking energy sources are considered as most people still rely on firewood and charcoal for their day to day cooking. These are just a few of the many additional challenges: 

The Grid is getting old and results in increased maintenance and operation cost.
Cost for unplanned maintenance and unforeseen faults is a pain for utilities and results in loss of revenue.
The Grid has not fully migrated to the edge or cloud to benefit from industry 4.0.
Data is in abundance but most of it is not utilized, a potential to start solving the above mentioned.
